# SCSV2-Lixing
## This is a Self-Calibration Sensing system based on Vibration and Vision, mainly built by Lixing He, supervised by Prof. Shijia Pan. Files: 
## mainfunc:
### load data (requires vibration data, vision data(can have different sample rate) and function to detect footstep) then give the result. Also show beam estimation error and comparison between theory and observation.
## testrevise:
### generate the association figure of vibration and vision and use iterative update algorithm
## findbeam:
### using footstep location vs signal energy to find the location of beam
## findlocation:
### using beams and footstep location vs signal energy to find locations of sensors
## vibrationfunc:
### our physical model, generate ideal footsteplocation vs signal energy
